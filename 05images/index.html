        <p>Music festivals have become insanely popular worldwide in the past century, but they weren’t always as we know them to be today. The origins of music festivals date back to <strong>Ancient Greece</strong>, with events that involved competitions in music and arts as well as sports. It was a celebration of culture, and over the years, elements have been added and changed to become the extravagant productions we now experience. </p>
